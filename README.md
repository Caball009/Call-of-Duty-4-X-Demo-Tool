## Credits:

- The code is based off parts of the Quake III Arena and Call of Duty 4 code.

- Cheers to the devs from CoD4X for simultaneously creating the problem of incompatible demos, as well as making much of the code needed to rectify this problem publicly available.  
- Cheers to Iswenzz for parts of the C++ code related to reading / parsing of demos.  
- Cheers to Du[R]eX for the code for the interactive .html page, and kudos for creating the first (public) CoD4 demo manager.
